# GA4Dataform Community

GA4Dataform Community is the open-source version of GA4Dataform Core.
This open-source repository contains all the Dataform files and folders that the [GA4Dataform Installer](https://setup.ga4dataform.com/) creates in Dataform.

You can use this repository to:
1. Explore the code before installing it
2. Implement parts of our queries or functions to your existing code
3. Connect it to your Dataform repository by yourself

Please take a look at our [documentation](https://docs.ga4dataform.com/docs/) if you want to learn more about GA4Dataform!
